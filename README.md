# The Rat Programming Language Specification #

`Rat` is a general purpose language on top of `go`. In short, `rat` is a superset of `go` plus generic and generator. `Rat` uses standard `go` syntax to express generic and generator. All `go` features are available in `rat` without any modification.

This repository defines all language features of `rat`. All language changes should be tracked and discussed in [project issues](https://github.com/go-rat/language-design/issues).

This specification can be viewed on gitbook: [The Rat Programming Language Specification](http://huandu.gitbooks.io/rat/).
